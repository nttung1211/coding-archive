  pipe can change anything we output to html

 -->

<!-- 
- updating data of the component doesn't trigger pipe to recalculate
- changing the argument pass to the pipe trigger that.
- we can force pipe recalculate whenever data updated by add pure: fasle to the pipe decorator (sometime we do need this like in the case of sort-pipe)
