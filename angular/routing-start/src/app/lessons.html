<!-- the "routerLink" attribute (on html) just changes the url and passes variables -->

<!-- *CHILD ROUTE* -->
<!-- if we set :
{ 
  path: 'users', 
  component: UsersComponent,
  children: [
    { 
      path: ':id/:name', 
      component: UserComponent 
    }
  ]
}

- every path has the form: /users/abc123/abc123 will be child of the '/users' and render the 'UserComponent' replacing <router-outlet> in the users.component.html or its child (but only one will be rendered).
- if a path is declare as a parent, every <router-outlet> put in it or its child will render the specified component in routing-module.

<!-- RESOLVER -->
<!-- 
  1. Purpose
  By implementing Resolver, we are going to fetch remote data from the server before the next component activatedRoute is activated, so there’s no need for a loading spinner (viewed or hidden), as we won’t navigate to the next component until the data is retrieved from the remote server.
