<!-- local reference or local reference with viewChild(). Do not use document method in Angular(cockpit)
* with local reference we get native elements

<input type="text" class="form-control" #serverInput>

<!-- ng-content 

  1.use when :
  - we want to pass a long logic into the child component
  - when a logic is used multiple time
  - when we want to use directly data from the parent with out having to pass through property binding

-->

<!-- contentChild vs viewChild:
       
  - view: get access to the element of the view as it looks or the shadow doom (from cockpit ts get access to the element in cockpit html ) 

  * if we use the selected element in side ngOninit we need to pass a second element ({ static: true }) to the viewChild.
  * with viewChild we get elementRefs.

  - content: get access to the element of the content as it really is (after being rendered) or the light doom (from server-element ts get access to the element in server-element html which is lexically written in the app ts)
