<!-- how to create a service (account.ts) -->

<!-- hierarchi of injection
- When the component is created, angular will instantiate the service its use and pass into the constructor function. The instance created is available to all the children of the component. 
- to use that instance from a child we just do not provide the provider (otherwise angular will instantiate a new object based on the provider which will override the passed instance)
- the highest level to place providers is in the app.module.ts
- every class has decorator pluged in is injectable. Since services don't have a decorators, if we want to inject a service into we need to add @injectable up onto the service. But we might want to add @injectable onto every service

<!-- event emitting service -->

<!-- 
  Instead of adding a service class to the providers[]  array in AppModule , you can set the following config in @Injectable() :
  
@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})
export class MyService { ... }
